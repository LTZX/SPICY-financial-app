# SPICY - Financial Application
## Purpose
This is part of the Portfolio Challenge, which is an intern activity at BlackRock. We worked as a team of 10 with some people who major in Financial related major, while others, including me, with tech background. For the activity, we needed to make a portfolio for our "client" with some specific background, and complete a marketing plan for the portfolio. This iOS App is part of the marketing plan, which is mainly focus on building a closer and more stable relation with our client.

## New Demands
Nowadays, more and more people do not only want a great amount of return, but also understand more and be more involved in their own investments. Since our "client" is an established individual, it is very possible that he or she has a good basic knowledge background. So, the client might want to put his or her own thoughts and decisions into the investments.

This App allows users to see the basic information about their own portfolios, and also live graphics and news that is related. The App has a detail few for each stock and ETF.

## Chat Bot
One highlight of this App is that it has a chat bot called Jasmine (The platform that BlackRock has is called Aladdin). This chat bot allows user to ask about the basic financial knowledge and live information about the ETFs and stocks.

## Progress
The activity was only for a few weeks. We did not link the App with live graphics and news. The chat bot only has the free trial for 7 days, and we only complete conversation for the presentation.
